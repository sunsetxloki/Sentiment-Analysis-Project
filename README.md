# **Sentiment Analysis Project** 🎬🧠

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis Project**, a machine learning application designed to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. This project demonstrates the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze text data effectively.

---

## **Overview** 📄

This project utilizes the IMDB dataset to train a sentiment analysis model. It implements the following:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Sentiment classification with a machine learning model (Logistic Regression)

Additionally, the project includes a Flask web application to allow users to input movie reviews and get real-time sentiment predictions.
